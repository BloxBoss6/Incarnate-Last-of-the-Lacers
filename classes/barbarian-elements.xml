			<p class="flavor">"Maybe your firelacing comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to."</p>
			<p class="indent">The Path of the Elements is one of contrast. Rage and serenity. Light and dark. Yin and yang. Those who follow this path learn to unlock their own lacing potential, expertly interspersing weapon attacks with elemental might.</p>
            <p class="indent">Most barbarian tribes become afiliated with a	single element, and lacers of its type appear in their number. No one can really explain this exclusivity, but tribes become fiercely territorial of their elemental powers. Lacing is seen as a divine gift, passed down from fallen comrades who have gone on to the Spirit World.</p>
